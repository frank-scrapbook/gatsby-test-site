- React = a library to break down UI into smaller pieces, called components.
- Component = a function that returns a React element.
- React elements can be written in JSX.

Page Components:
- Contain all UI elements for a specific page of your site.
- Gatsby auto creates pages for components that are the default exports of files in the src/pages directory.
- Name of file is used as route for the page.

Building-block components:
- Smaller reusable parts of your UI.
- Can be imported into page components or other building block components.

- You can import "pre-built" components (like <Link>) from other packages.
- OR
- you can write your own custom components from scratch (like <Layout>).

- You can use props to change how a component renders.
- You can define your own props when you build a component.
- React has built-in props like 'children' and 'className'.

- Gatsby isn't opinionated about what styling approach you want to use.
- But by default, Gatsby works with CSS Modules.
